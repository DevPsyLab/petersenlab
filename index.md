# Package Overview

The `petersenlab` package contains a collection `R` functions that are
widely used by the Petersen Lab (the [Developmental Psychopathology
Lab](https://developmental-psychopathology.lab.uiowa.edu) at the
University of Iowa). Included are functions for various purposes,
including evaluating the accuracy of judgments and predictions,
performing scoring of assessments, generating correlation matrices,
conversion of data between various types, data management, psychometric
evaluation, extensions related to latent variable modeling, various
plotting capabilities, and other miscellaneous useful functions. By
making the package available, we hope to make our methods reproducible
and replicable by others and to help others perform their data
processing and analysis methods more easily and efficiently. The package
website is here: <https://devpsylab.github.io/petersenlab/>. The source
code for the package is here:
