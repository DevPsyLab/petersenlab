\usage{
reliabilityOfProductTerm(x, y, reliabilityX, reliabilityY)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of one variable that is used in the computation of the
product term.}

\item{y}{Vector of second variable that is used in the computation of the
product term.}

\item{reliabilityX}{The reliability of the \code{x} variable.}

\item{reliabilityY}{The reliability of the \code{y} variable.}
}
\value{
Reliability of the product term that is computed from the multiplication of
\code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\description{
Estimate the reliability of a product term (assuming the individual indices
are centered for the computation of the product term).
