\usage{
puc(numItems, numSpecificFactors)
}
\arguments{
\item{numItems}{Number of items (or indicators).}

\item{numSpecificFactors}{Number of specific factors.}
}
\value{
Percent of Uncontaminated Correlations (PUC).
}
\description{
Percent of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) from bifactor model.
}
\details{
Estimates the percent of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) from a bifactor
model. The PUC represents the percentage of correlations (i.e., covariance
terms) that reflect variance from only the general factor (i.e., not
variance from a specific factor). Correlations that are explained by the
specific factors are considered "contaminated" by multidimensionality.
