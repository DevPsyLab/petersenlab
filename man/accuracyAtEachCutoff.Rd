\description{
Find the accuracy at each possible cutoff. Actuals should be binary,
where \code{1} = present and \code{0} = absent.
}
\details{
Compute accuracy indices of predicted values in relation to actual values at
each possible cutoff by specifying the predicted values and actual values.
The target condition is considered present at or above each cutoff value.
Optionally, you can specify the utility of hits, misses, correct rejections,
and false alarms to calculate the overall utility of each possible cutoff.
