Description: A collection of R functions that are widely used by the Petersen
    Lab. Included are functions for various purposes, including evaluating the
    accuracy of judgments and predictions, performing scoring of assessments,
    generating correlation matrices, conversion of data between various types,
    data management, psychometric evaluation, extensions related to latent
    variable modeling, various plotting capabilities, and other miscellaneous
    useful functions. By making the package available, we hope to make our
    methods reproducible and replicable by others and to help others perform
    their data processing and analysis methods more easily and efficiently. The
    codebase is provided in Petersen (2024) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.7602890> and on
    CRAN: <doi: 10.32614/CRAN.package.petersenlab>. The package is described in
    "Principles of Psychological Assessment: With Applied Examples in R"
    (Petersen, 2024) <doi:10.1201/9781003357421>, <doi:10.5281/zenodo.6466589>.
